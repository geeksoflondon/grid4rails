/* NOTES: Small 
-----------------------------

** Use names for font sizes
** Don't try to use positioning
** Probably only one typeface per page
** Probably won't respect typeface specified
** Keep tables ~very~ simple: no border-collapse, 
*  thead, tbody or varying border widths/colours/styles.
** No image-replacement
** Avoid using large and/or wide images in content
** Screen resolution is likely to be relatively narrow and shallow,
*  eg. 176x144
** KEYBOARD NAVIGATION
*  (remember :focus as well as :hover)


/* NOTES: Medium
-----------------------------
** Can use px for font size
** Don't try to use complex positioning
** Typeface still unlikely to be the one you specify
** Default screen resolution still pretty narrow,
*  eg. 320x480
** No CSS3
** Touchscreen navigation
*  (:hover irrelevant)
-----------------------------*/


/* NOTES: Large
-----------------------------
** Go for it. CSS3, the lot.
** med.css applied first.  
** Mouse and touchscreen navigation
** Screen resolution likely to range
*  from 320x480 to 1920x1080
